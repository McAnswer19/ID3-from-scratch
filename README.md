# ID3_from_scratch

Code for an ID3 decision tree implemented from scratch in Python. This was part of a class assignment into tree-based machine learning algorithms, and overall I think it turned out pretty well. If this were professional production code it would be written in Cython to optimize performance, but this assignment was meant more to teach us the concepts surrounding decision trees and random forests than to make something for professional use.
